It is used to authenticate the application to access resources, and also to assign permissions to those resources. A service principal is like a user identity (login and password or certificate) for an application. An application object, on the other hand, is a representation of an application in Azure Active Directory. It contains information about the application, such as its name and URL, as well as its associated service principal. In summary, a service principal is a security identity used to authenticate an application, while an application object is a representation of the application in Azure Active Directory that contains information about the application and its associated service principal.

Investigators can use the Send event to identify email sent from a compromised account. The audit record for a Send event contains information about the message, such as when the message was sent, the InternetMessage ID, the subject line, and if the message contained attachments. This auditing information can help investigators identify information about email messages sent from a compromised account or sent by an attacker. Additionally, investigators can use a Microsoft 365 Discovery tool to search for the message (by using the subject line or message ID) to identify the recipients the message was sent to and the actual contents of the sent message."
